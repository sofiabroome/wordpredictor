Song:   Ninjitzu
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: Raw (Celo)]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Comin' at 'cha...)

[Chorus x2: Celo, Raw]
Niggaz wanna flow the distance they can't do
Karate, I'll kick ya ass with Ninjitzu
Niggaz wanna flow the distance they can't do
Karate, I'll kick ya ass with Ninjitzu

[Raw]
I wonder who's the real one, so pound my back
When confronted with the pressure yo they ready to trap
Not quick to bust a gat or short on that chit-chat
Ain't tryin' to hear that crap, all my Zu Ninjaz stick together like Kit Kats
All you bitch niggaz suck a dick that's fat
On all fours, once you got me you can't hold your's
You wait like inhabitable whores, I cut you up and now you hurt like sores
Ready to buy-in some more, cuz you fake niggaz be screamin' hardcore
When drama sets in you be shittin' ya draws
Scared to walk to the store
Feel ya life frightened cuz of the sightings you endure
I eat you steak niggaz for dinner, on the ender I'm Raw you tenor
You think you tough cuz you bigger, I'm the bigger committer
Yo I'm nice with my nift swift hand moves
Tight and quick kicks that got blows
Firin' for that man's toes, I prefer to settle beef like old school
Or bless, so why not give my knuckles a kiss you little bitch

[D.L.]
Another fat mastermind blast rhymes just like a nine
Nothin' nice or kind, I intertwine with the refined like fine wine
Designed mine, get better with time
Gettin' cheddar while you nickel and dime, my rhymes shine
It's prime time, so step in the spot and make the plot thicken
It's D.L., what the hell? Rhymes be bullshittin'
I burn down mics like arsons on purpose
Smashin' any worthless MC to come to surface

[Chorus]

[K-Blunt]
You guessed it, we be the best at this
Watch, you just, pushed the Lexus
I'm catchin' CREAM with the rap Dream Team
Craziest bunch of niggaz that you ever could've seen
Aiyo, fuck that, this is how I do when I rap
Brooklyn Zu consists of crazy-ass niggaz with gats
Watch the blade it might cut ya back, counter-attack
If you dare get locked in here like the Hunchback
Better yet, get ya whole shit taxed
Technique, and ya whole fuckin' style is wack
Kill yaself, kamikaze like Jax, more accurate than road maps
I separate like math, ya wack from the black
Division, from the fact, with the Gods on the hunt now ya hooked and trapped
Bring it on back

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Bring it on back!
Yo yo.. I saved that for real!
My infrared blasts ya head, crazy like Screwface the fuckin' dread
Marked for Death, Steven Seagal control gangs like a ref
I bust you like a Tec.. Blaow! Blaow!
I make ya body wet, it means business
Uplift, the scratch when you itch, I'm somethin' sick
Rap A.K., match with slaves, roll 4-5-6, fat cars with the kit
Alkoholik with Tha Liks, I'm mad at pussy cuz I got a dick
I add on like a three point shot, lyrics shoots like blaow!

[Chorus]

[Break: Celo]
Niggaz wanna flow the distance, can't do it
Nigga, flow like fluid, burn right through it
Yo, niggaz know it, can't fuck with these poets
Word up, can't stop the flow
You know.. Zu Ninja, on attack
Bring it back.. nigga.. nuh, nuh, nuh

[Chorus]

[Outro: Celo]
Ah... ninjitzu, ninjitzu
Zu, Zu, ninjitzu, ninjitzu.. slicin' ya track"

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: 12 O'Clock]
Muthafucka...
My muthafuckin' brother came up to me...
He said my shit will sound corny...
I said... right... right...
My nigga Irie in this muthafucka...
Popa Chief in this muthafucka...
K-Blunt in this muthafucka...
White boy engineer in this muthafucka...
I got my niggas in this muthafucka...
P in this muthafucka...
12 O'Clock in this muthafucka...
Fly...

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
I shoot on right on through space like John Clemm
The original bad boy, son, like Sean Penn
Correspondent on News 10
12 O'Clock called me a brother then
Sometime my life be looking grim
If it wasn't for time, I'd be stuck in sin
To be different and set trends
I rock Tommy Hill gold and write with Buddha Monk
Pens, wearing Wu-Wear from the head to the shins
Put on my Polo socks and lace up my blue Timbs
I clean my Italian link with the Scorpio medallion
My ghetto life, that's how my day begins
My cousin Compton, that's my next to kin
He said I'm too hunt, too much adrenaline

[Popa Chief]
I got a Ninja team that gleam like the sun dipped in Afro Sheen
Redrummin' tracks, that'll rumpture your spleen
It's the major leaguers, givin' party fevers
At equal oppurtunity slayers, we don't discriminate
It's time to up the party, grab my height to obliverate
Can I bang on your eardrums with this one, it's a hit son
You should've never dissed the champion, dunn
That's like doing a juks and fumbling your gun
That's like, bagging a million cracks up and only selling one
Ya'll politic a nigga like me, politate
The most shockinest raps you ever, heard on tape
Play us here, some to hate, I process seaweed
Told you we was gonna be somebody, you didn't believe me
Silverback gorilla style, two-way ship piles
All over the world catching frequent flyer miles
Check a nigga out, eat your fucking heart out
Everybody cop a dub, let's have a cookout

[Chorus: all]
The moment we been longing for, living for
Training for, fuck what you heard, it's all about the transfers
And we refuse to be, have nots anymore
Give me the mic and score, when it rains, it pours

[D.L.]
While I rap and cap, I blow with a bat, cockin' it back
With a battle axe, my firery vocals melts the wax
I slaughter your tape recorder, message holds the leverage
Tipsy off my rhymes, like an alcoholic beverage
I stand on the platform, control this all alone
Platinum microphone with a solid gold throne
I bomb on your village, have your city overthrown
Pen's hotter than skillets, engrave my lyrics into stone
Yo, we thug shit, crip with blood shit, bust slugs shit
Lay you down with the four-pound, I'm on some thug shit

[Popa Chief]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo hold on
Yo, this is for the radio!

[12 O'Clock]
Let's make a motion picture, put Zu in a haunted house
Nigga change to Old Gold, and case of Guiness Stout
Forty blunts each, nigga mouth laced up
Put the stakes up, rock the door, brought the windows up
Handcuffed to each other, silver plate mixed with coke & dust
It's digital, shit getting critical
Trying to escape, but no way, I'm in the castle
Surrounded by a lake, alligators & rottweilers, and the fruit to swallow
Naked bitch in a basement, it make no sense
It's senseless, paranoid and recorded before
Making noise, me and my boys, playing hood like Ice Cube

[K-Blunt]
You heard? We be them special Ninjaz
Self employed, self educated
Mad years we waited, for the oppurtunity
Who working these mic's for me?
If tonight is my night, super nigga eat the kryptonite
Vision complete, this the hour that we'll face defeat
War, scars, rhymes be falling like stars
Nigga think big, be big...

You are difficult to kill, ninja
Well then relieve him of his pain

[Intro: Celoo (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
(I told you to stop startin' wars, nigga!)
Zu Zu Zu Zu.. can't be defeated, nigga, what? (Take this!)
Check the shit out, nigga (Celo, yo bust that shit!)

[Celo]
Yo ya trouble's a rave, cut through ya heart like spades
Feel ya raps laid from missed days, worse than pharaoh's days
My rhyme's a culture, a culture's a way of life
Went to war with you devils on mics, earnin' my stripes
You niggaz all about sex, ice and gold chains
Gettin' high in a Lex, poppin' bottles of champagne
These last days, ain't no time for fakin' jacks
We live it, hip-hop, you bullshit rappers is an act
Niggaz get smacked like bad seeds talkin' back
Discipline with my iron rhymin', you blend it in track

[Rambo]
Yo I slice the sword across the water, murder, murder, torture, torture
Get exactly what you ordered, peepin' Hell with ice water
You drown in my sound, strike hard without life guard
Disrupt ya brain with the force of a pipe wand
Hurts, hit 'em, break 'em down to the floor
You don't want no more, soldier catch war
Rippin' to shreds, ya takin' this to the head
At night he bled, by the day he was dead
Mentally fed, he ate too much, he was stuffed
Called his bluff, what he say, thought he was tough
I break him, never know who rappin' rhymes make take him
Pitbull shake him, government picture representer
Never enter, I close the gate, you move too late
Fuck all the hook-ups, it's straight paper for a plate

[Raw]
I turn ya vest into bust, lay ya verse in a hearst
Then I straighten ya bucks, it's senseless to act relentless
My squad feels no repentence for Ninja Scroll's resistence
I baracade ya raid and freeze ya existence
For tryin' to repel the God, quest law as the serpent that crawls
Through the minds of the blind, deaf and dumb
One rhyme combined is how the war was one
See I player hate none, cuz while y'all all players I'm the world champion
I'm dissin' all you wake niggaz, catch a tantrum
Wannabes to my Zu, son, come and ask, son
What? What? I flip the script with a duck, my rhymes are God
When Ninjaz on to the cut, do you wanna be pissed?
On lips in ya strut, now bow to the Raw
I reign by the day and I rule the nightfall
As intense soldier, makin' a cause
I'm a scorn to the game, at the house superior!

That's enough! We will meet again..

[Hook - 2x]
Who could it be (who could it be)
But that M double A-B (but that M double A-B)
And we're sho nuff gon shine (and we're sho nuff gon shine)
Making everybody lose their mind (everybody losing they mind)

[Trae]
The same niggaz on the block, wrecking it won't stop
We bout to head to the top, cocked dropping the top
With glocks ready to box, somebody bout to get dropped
Fuck around with the Maab, you fin to get shined out
Do you really, wanna fuck around wit us
Come out of the trunk, with a AK with us
Better watch out for brains, you got a one hitter quitter
Nigga we the Southside, H-Town mob figgas
Raw niggaz, on the block affiliated with drug dealers
Go getters, and a hundred percent thug niggaz
You don't wanna step to us, you getting hugged nigga
On the microphone with flow, you get drugged nigga
You better get somewhere, you can't block the shine
I'm ready for any nigga, that wanna get out of line
I'll tell you one mo' time, you better respect my mind
When a red light shine, go and lay it down
Who the niggaz that wanna talk down
Who the bitch that wanna hate, I'm fin to sweat up they face
Me and Doug and Ro, up on a paper chase
Trying to get it like a fiend, with a top case
In the race we done did that, candy blue
In the lap, wearing a black hat fuck that
Somebody fin to get done, till everybody be gon
And nigga, we number one

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
I'ma give it to you live, I'ma give it to you raw
I ain't even fin to play, with you motherfuckers
I'm a motherfucker, that'll be packing a glock
Taking em out with red dots, I'm a head busta
I'ma Maab out I'ma ride out, no doubt
Making motherfuckers slide out, need to hide out
Fuck around with the wrong nigga, pull the nine out
Leave a motherfucker crispy, burned and fried out
Does the Dougie give it out, mmm-hmm
Like a nigga be smoking up on, good green fur
Fucking em up in the first round, yes sir
I'm just so cold, I make a nigga say burr
Gripping a round, me and my dogs get bucked
With the Lil' Cl'Che, still ready to get crunk
We M double A-B, now little bitch what
On a treaty the microphone, we ain't no punk
Dougie D so thoed, and they already know
The Trae and the J Z-Ro, the By-Bo
Got a kin folk raw, that be gripping a gun
I got a king folk right, that be dropping a bomb
I got a click of motherfuckers, putting words on the run
And when you thought it was over, nigga it just begun
And when you hear this shit, nigga don't you bump
When you feel you ready, nigga then come get some

[Hook - 2x]

[Cl'Che]
Got em all asking, who could it be
That Guerilla M double A-B, and C-L-C-H-E
The classified lady, sho nuff
Watch me shine up on the scene, make em all say their so thoed
Sitting back on these hoes, that's trying to out do my flows
And all I wanna do is get the key, and open the do'
For my Southeastern pros, fuck it let's show em that we could
Swang the 4's, I'm on a mission steady trying to get the cream
Maab deep, with the KMJ killa team
Doing things, making mo' money than you ever seen
While you watching me, on your big screen
BET or MTV, posters hanging at your local grocery
Now everybody know me, Cl'Che make you lose your mind
Everytime you jam a Maab c.d., the Classified's on your mind
Southside I bring it to you live, so please don't underestimate me
Or my niggaz Trae, Dougie D and Z-Ro sing the hook for me

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Who could it be, blowing on doja
Consuming codeine, cause I'm just a soldier
That stays on his grind, chasing that feddy
These fellas they ain't ready, they lightweight and I'm heavy
The Mo City Don, king of the ghetto
I keep dropping bombs, cause I just can't let go
I'm thoed in the game, hydro or that do-do
Catch Z-Ro in slow-mo, Z-Ro not no hoe thogh
I swang and I swerve, like Tony Montana
My balls are my word, come down your chimney like Santa
And put you to bed, for talking down on a O.G
Really though y'all don't know me, I will make you die slowly

Album:  Elements (S)
Song:   Elements
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Kung fu sample]
The ninja was an ancient Chinese skill
It evolved in Japan into the ninja art
	The 5 element formations are very elusive and powerful
        Why is the ninja so deadly?
Indeed, the ninja art is really elusive
It orginated from Chinese power sources
And blossomed from the era of the three kingdoms
The 5 element formations are indeed mind-boggling
All of the elements: gold, water, fire, earth and wood
Are used to the fullest advantage
There is few who lodge it with hand-drawn weapons, let alone survive it

[K-Blunt]
Just one of the elements, is very relevant
Like bitches being celebate, she selling it, you buying it
But trying it, after buying it, keep it high, intense
My intent, kill like pussy, no evidence
Common sense, stepping to the ninja can be hazardous
Especially since Now Justice, crept with confidence
I move like wind, simply deading him
And the rest of them, saw how quick, I hit, spit arsenic

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Natural disaster Katrina
Take you on a road trip like you all connected to a Beamer
Rappers get the middle finger, they frauds
They turn to R&B singers, like RuPaul
Give the po-po the cue ball but eight-ball wins
5 Foot Hyper sniper, never challenge me, that's a sin
Mixed with Hennessey and gin, ninja masters, ninja mindbender
Turn ya light dimmer and dimmer
Simon says you're dead so off with ya wack-ass head"

Yo start swingin' that wild shit, uppercut to the chin
Got you stonin', spittin' blood while you tumblin'
Got peeps to drop the fuck out
Ya seconds away from gettin' knocked the fuck out
And ya eyes bleedin', never been breathin', no longer bobbin' and weavin'
Tryin' to throw a low blow, ya opcipital, here comes the T.K.O.
Tell ya kids to roll, snitches where ya arms are?
Stop tellin' bro' to fight ours, I cut ya right arm
Put a left to ya neck, and you gaspin' and shit
Just got yo' ass kicked, gotta give me my respect
Gotta give me my cheque

My .380 blast niggaz, see a trade, nigga

Yo, I bury MC's like Dirt Dog, to the bone
The biggest homes, to the poems, to tastes like styrofoam
Court jesters never get to sit on thrones
Popa Chief the widowmaker, ya baby-daddy ain't comin' home
Pretty boy's voice sings, puppet masters work the strings
With no lane trigger, how you claim the king?
Unmeasureable joy I bring to the function
How you gon' be fly with two broken wings?
Niggaz with no stripes, jaws stay tight
Planned on taken me out? Ya better take flight
Never be Blakk enough to test my Tann
Silly man, ya rather take a bath in quicksand
Never worry, last cat got bodied and buried
Too much pressure on him and jumpshot hurried
I slipped and dipped, bust his lip when I flurried
With all the fixings Kamikaze left him curried
Then slam dunked the punk, huffed the tree trunk
Rocked the hat of the dunce, once, little nappy cunt
Fourth down situation, we never punks
Huh, cocked the homeruns off bunts

(Ordinarily, steadily) enormally, precisely
Slowly break down ya stamina and crush ya weak ass character

4-5-6 the guillotine, chop ya head off clean
Then flee the murder scene, I mean with this lyrical line I rhyme
It's the Ninja, props from the exit to the enter
With the same old wear that I wore last year
A little lighter, less food, more beer
Pocket full of wooden nickels
Printed in culture deal pickels, fans still cuz you fickle
Do ya best shit it tickles, haha
The world gonna laugh at you, said it again
Like the waistband in panties, niggaz is feminine
Bring it back like actual facts, pass it to me
You might not get it back!

That constantly extend (Yo Duck Lo!)
Don't deal with hoes who choose to blow they nose
Fake niggaz with no dough posin' at our shows
Yeah, I pioneer my hits from last year
Masterpieces in stereo to lace up the radio
My authority overrules the majority
Indescent inpurities, slaughter for my orderlies

Fertilize ya third eye if ya mind's unstable
Bust ya bluffs with slugs, wear ya hooks with rapper cables

You stunk six, half the time you goin' raw in these Brooklyn tricks
You was born to ride dicks like them bitches in porno flicks
Why you ridin' my shit? Cuz I love to make hits
With thirty Zu misfits dressed in Ninja outfits
Take control like cop picks, relax while I rock shit
Ninjaz got that hot shit for mics like chocolate

[Popa Chief]
It's about pickin' through the right place at the right time
With ya right rhyme, Ninjaz stand on the gold mine
Flippin' the scripts, ninety-eight Tales from the Crypts
Bigger pools, bigger sips, international trips
Bigger arrows, bigger tips, ghetto antics
Combine with Ninja tactics, scientific, pornographic flicks get fetched
Don't believe it? You better check my statistics
Bust it, Popa Chief, far from a beginner
Breakin' the seam, disappear in thin air
Leavin' the rest of 'em, green with envy
or at least with jealously cuz my team ain't friendly
It's not my fault I'm the lyrical Pathfinder
Like Beavis and Butthead, Doing America
Trailblazin', arson braisin'
A hero like Hogan, rippin' the illest slogans
We represent like the Nation of Domination!"

[Z-Ro talking]
Yes indeed, H-Town, it go down Lil' Flex, Z-Ro, Big Mello
Know what I'm saying, you boys can't stop us man
Unstopable, feel me, yeah
They got to feel us till they kill us, this for the radio

[Lil' Flex]
Ain't nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can't fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of y'all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

[Chorus]
Still standing, and you know we represent the south
And ya know ya know we represent the south 
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out

[Big Mello]
I represent that S-O-U-T-H to the S-I-D-E
Drop screens you can see me completely
Off the heezy, fa sheezy I'm breezy
Cause my diamonds they be known to blind hoes like Stevie
Believe me, outstanding with my family
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop
Won't stop, how it go down
Harm clock, Mo City, south west still shine, wooo

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain't having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most
Big Mello and Lil' Flex and Z-Ro the crooked as your folks and we

Yeah.. yeah, yeah, yeah, there they go, son
Kamikaze assassin.. they got hear it, yo son
Let 'em know, son, Dirty Bastard
Brooklyn Zu...

[K-Blunt]
I transform like water, the ninja, verbal manslaughter
That enters bloodstreams like poison, throughout the body
No remedy to save the, I caught you from Trenton to Kalamazoo (Haha Brooklyn!)
Don't stop, powers refined, liftin' two cents to ten times, wastin' no time
My wisdom, makes a large impact like 151 in the batch cookin' crack
In fact, where I come from I practice deadly
and rarely do they show their skills cuz they're scary
No way to, counter, flows that found you
You asked for this, so holy graduous
Shoulda shut ya mouth before you lost ya teeth (to late)
Now them shits is, fallin' out ya face
Can't wait 'til that sound sign on wax
Tell the truth, give a million folks the facts
Kamikaze attacks, out the darkness
First one with the fire so I spark this
K-Blunt, saluted, undisputed as an artist
Out the mouth rambler, who's the gambler?

[Chorus: Raw]

[Black Lantern]
Rome the streets in my dome, I'm ba-ba-bad to the bone
Hard likes tone, take advice, keep ya ass home
Ya prepare, ya search but the truth's already there
You stare cuz it's never been brought, under the care
Of the orderly direct, in fact, you're in correct
The outcome is death, sword across ya neck
I cause mad wreck and pain from my scorchin' flame
Many bodies I claim, militant, from out my name

[Drunken Dragon]
Now listen here, the majority of these MC's is superficial
Your lyrics so ass, ya raps'll rip tissue
Nobody's gonna miss you, printed ya last issue
Concide it, this is played out, that's why them raps hit you
(Yo, I'ma make this..) I don't give a fuck about, what a nigga got
If ya bust ya glock, if ya sellin' rocks
Boy ya still get dropped, stop before I hurt you
Lyrically I make tough MC's turn commercial

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, I'ma make this hit, bump up yo' shit
Warfare flick, bitch can't tamper with it
Stop fuckin' with the black, kids, keep it on-on down
Tell the truth, kill ya lies, still respect yo' sound
Ain't no punk, it's just I'll always be around
Fuck y'all, nigga, that's how we gets down
I make you, shake you, urk you then I break you
I'm Ason and then I'm gone, then I take ya ass on
for the hip-hop ride, nigga please, step inside, and then ya die

Popa Chief, hard-headed, black-hearted
It don't take much to get a nig like me started
Off the top rope, lovely, with this one
Put ya head up like a well-trained Pokemon
Verbal shogun, we all known the outcome
Another hit courtesy of Holy Woly Productions

[Raw]
Just acknowledge the ways and just how I
Gets prayin' like professor, son of a best
Take a lesson, angelic ad-libs
Mass transit grabs kids then our scripts flip like back-flips
Mathematic teachings combine with ninja tactics
Cut ya bars, pre-teens get injured with that racket
Zu comin' through makin' chumps out you bad kids
Colorize, terrorize, computerize, third eye, yo!

It's not all about running your mouth all the time
It's all about stacking your change
Now I don't know if you've been told
I make it hot your ass gone have to stay in doors
Cause I'm a gangsta, gangsta
Diamond in the back, sun roof top
Grill in the front steady making it drop, the bubble grey, all day
So when you see me swanging, knocking the belts off the bumper banging
It don't stop, and it won't stop

I'm your partner, I'm your nigga
Went from broke to bigger figgas
Not no buster, I'm a real g
Even keep us in this rugged penitentiary
You know me, Bridgemont 4
I represent whatever real I couldn't be a hoe
What's my name (Z-Ro), what's my name (Z-Ro), Z-Ro


[Z-Ro]
Here we go, fanatical radical rhyme flow
Started out with a passion for music loving how it go
I use to, talk about poverty, talk about crooked cops
Talk about grown men raping children it ain't gone ever stop
I'm a spokesman for the ghetto nearest you
I'm a Picaso in the this rap game
paint a picture giving you the clearest view
24/7, 3-65 I'ma pump, put it to mama
I'm a hustler I done said you a camel with no humps
Look What You Did To Me was my first c.d.
If it went three final on that I never had a worse c.d.
Geurialla Maab riots, Z-Ro Vs. The World, King Of The Ghetto
I done grabbed hold to the rap game and can't let go
I'm a feed it to you through the speaker
listen at the highs listen at the mids
Everybody loving this even let the old folks listen and the kids
Certified ghetto platinum, cause I'm a champion
But it's for the money, catch it dead if you don't have no fun

[Z-Ro]
It's been a long time I've been out on the grind trying to find my way
But I can't escape none of the drama, haters jepordize my day
I tried to walk on the straight and narrow
and try to stay as sane as I can
But I'm just a man, doing all I can
Have mercy on me father, I'm guilty 
but I'm trying harder to do right, do right
But will I see my children starving
I get gangster and I start to mobbing
It don't stop, and it won't stop

Would you follow me around
If I, I hung out on your block
Would you telephone a cop

And took her to the creek and fucked her in the water
Then she brought me home and I put on your robe
Would you be mad enough to let your barrels explode

[Syn]
If I sold your son cocaine
Would you put a bullet in my brain
If I, I stole your favorite cow
Would you cock the hammer back and be like pow, I bet you would

I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me
I think I like it here, I'm movin' in today, come and get me
I think I like it here, ok, I'll stay, it fits me

Your daughter, she just had sex with me
I fed her some drank and ecstasy
If I, if I don't steal your cow
Would you let me live in your barn

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don't have a problem with small town folk, nope
I like y'all, as soon as I flip this dope
I'm a open a titty bar next to the school, uh ha
I'm glad we all neighbors, I mean, I think it's cool

If I walked up at your church drunk out my mind
Would you still let me sip up on that red wine

Would you help me and pass these flyers round, yeah

Southern love baby, don't doubt it
Don't let my records fool you, I'm about it

Beat they wife and yet serve no bids
Only judge in town, he also the cop
He also the barber at the hair chop shop
He the mayor, the clerk, and what I'm speakin', shit
He the one fuckin' his kids and wife beatin'
There ain't no law, gonna punish himself
And that's why the carnival's bad for your health
When we get there, we gonna get rid of ya
They gon' find a piece of ya head in Bolivia
I'll lay you out front with your corpse to rest
And a Hatchetman flag stickin' outta your chest
Say hello to the new sherif, Violent J
With one law, let there be Juggalo-ism all day

I keep a vest on, I keep my chest on (look at me)
With a real groupie when pull out a press on (look at me)
I might dress prepped up but I still do crime (look at me)

Buddha Monk, word, yo, yo, aight..

All stand at attention, it's a spank in the lung
Some of y'all niggas be sometime
Sometime you build, sometime you rhyme all the time
We break out the snake pit, make hits
Blood in, blood out, dealin with the bullshit
Too complex, make it easy, elementary
So we can, teach these babies
Crawl before you walk, think before you talk
Don't mislead 'em, fall you bleeder
Now take me to your leader
Decention in the ranks, divide and conquer
What you say, thanks to the weed and liquor
Cocaine and bitches, diamonds, big chains, more riches
Shiny cars and nothin man-maken
Reach these stars, get in where you fit in
Who you be, who you are
I be your father, in the Vanguard
Conductor of the orchestra
Universal Soldier, Zu Ninja!

[Delta One]
Thoughts controllin your destiny
Your memories, floatin in cups of Hennessey
Logically, it's like, niggas battle to bite
So I rip mic's tight and vibe, right
We shine on eachother to the climax
On your best systems, I'm deep like addiction
Whenever I'm cross-mixin, the slang
Delta One drama with them joints that will spark up your brain
Now your rhymes are defeated from my circle of fame
Beats not tame, run loose out an individual
I enter you, contact, essen-tual
The hip-hop sentinel, over-dosin you
Out of a chosen few
No host to guide you across the East Coast
You held a few tight knifes, but who's to pay the price?
Throw the dice, seein through my father's eye-sights
85% of them could change your life to kill the hate
The pain is great, to exchange, moments of your fate
Now we came so strong, the pain is gone
Mama said, ""Don't aim home, or you might blast him in the arm.
Son, my word is based on the strength of the strong.
You'll be the same one, now you got your life in his palm.""

[Spiritual Assassin]
Yo relax like pools, and spar, the broads
85er's and Gods, peep the announcement
Stick your neck out, niggas give their ass to kiss
Leave ya assed out and bone dry like dried up tears
My thoughts, thermeate collector's addition
Cherish life on my seven and a half mic's
It's precious like black Dad's kids, valuable
Natural like resources, symbolic to 100% fruit juices
Yo the truth ran from the East like Musa from police
Gonna leep over obsticles like a pair of rules
Never step in the next man Wally shoes
Who the fuck wanna spar inside a highway?
Yo we cross-break boulevards, on the block is like shootouts
Cookouts, charcoil niggas is hot on the grill
I reveal to the ears, embrace with open arms
Thrown, incasin my rhyme, Brooklyn the gold frame
Praise my name and the niggas I run with
World Class, yo we're legends

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Yo true like the Terminater
I Shoot to Kill, an MC like Space Invaders
Lyrical exterminator, in this music we call rap
Incinerate my top cats, kill the mice in the back
Yo don't continue, the God kills the jack
Read your Scooby, snap! That's the way we attack
a hip-hop track, like a Predator
Wild life, ready to fight, the Brooklyn mic
Yo if niggaz persist, I'm tearin ya, Ike-smack!
Now we got it right, Zu Ninjaz performin tonight
On stage, under the lights, rhymes tight
Blow like crack in the pipe

Is my mind explicit cause I hang with a sinner
Hand in hand with the Hatchet but it's nothin' familiar
Non believers keep walking till we finally arrive
Black smoke around the family with the red in our eyes
Cold chills from the death, holding onto the past
With a pistol to the temple cause your life movin' fast
Devastated by the anger that you need to escape
Right hand on the book, flip the page, choose your fate

[Syn]
Kiss the dead on the red moon night
Will they cry, well I think they just might
Torturing, what's a frozen tear
This ain't hell, but I'd rather be there
Spiderweb, makes it hard to move
Death awaits, yet I have nothing to prove
Twisted soul, in my mental game
Murder comes and goes with no kind of blame

Power drains as the dark becomes light
Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight
What will ever become of this book that I hold

Rain drops fall from the dark night sky
Bodies crawl from garbage cans and alley ways alike
You can find me there in the shadows without a doubt
Time for my people and me to come about
Children of the river and the misunderstood
Downtrodden and forgotten but still it's all good
Now what you throw away is ours to keep
You know the children need a pillow when they go to fuckin' sleep

Your disease, it's quite infectious
Once I know you're the object of my lust
Acid rain, come on and stick out your tongue
There's enough for each and every single one
Right or left, c-c-come follow me
Pyramids, l-lobotomy is necessary
Crystal ball, it's just Synplicity
Kings and queens, just show us where we should be, you motherfuckers

Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight

I was runnin' with a Hatchet down the block
My leg got popped when I copped a dub at the dope spot
Everybody out to get me everywhere I go
Is it a sin to get your dick sucked by a ho, fuck no
What about the fact that I bring the dope guns
Stay outta my way and don't make me have to use one
Can't help the feeling, my head overloads
Pull the trigger and unload

I came from underground, where my hood resigned
Nothing left but the bad and ugly cause the good done died
We tried laying low niggas want to cross them lines
So when I'm saying so you getting bumped off this time
Fuck a throw away, I'm looking for the gun in your house
To kill your family for some shit they ain't know nothing about
We running the south, while other niggas running they mouth
If you smart, you'll take cover cause we come in your route
Cause when we ride you could best believe there's guns in sight
How many times mama cried cause her sons done died
I pull my nine out, all of my barrels are fouled out
So the bullets that I bust the feds don't find out
Which gun, which nigga, which figga points to the trigger man
Still well connected not worried about who's the bigger man
Z-Ro, my nigga man, Pharoah, the Killa Klan

When it's time to ride you know I'm ready to activate my gun

And the outcome you stuck with, if I got to blast
I'm coming to get you, pull your punk ass out the picture
And fix the braids on your head, that means I'ma get richer
P-H-A-R-O-A-H, now you know 
My motherfucking name I never play fake
Easy does it, do it easy when I execute
To that nigga and the darkside when my weapon shoot
Shoot again and feel like I just made boy

Murdering edition, I make a motherfucker disappear
Slip the clip in, open fire then dripping him

I put stitches in the general son of a bitch nigga when he bump up
Running to the trunk for the pump, I'm already ready to dump

Dude we taking over this bitch and here to demonstrate demands
And bitch the down south gangsta R-A-P, 1990
Started with Street Military and K-A-G

Weed it up inflate it down, you damn shot and flipped the meat wagon
So save me some son of a guns, when it's over
We one of the ones on the top, haters smell it and running to come

Fuck your crime rate and murder rate, running up on Houston Texas
Well it be fuck y'all for trying to funk us on a burning day

Typed by: Lil Hustle

(Billy Cook)
Yeah, yeah, Z-Ro, DP, Billy Cook lay it down
All night long, smoked all fire, yeah yeah

[Z-Ro]
We can ball all day, four play in the hallway
Taking trips overseas, France, England, and my way
I'm the Don Datta, but you can't be my baby mama
Let me save you the drama, roll on like a Yokohama
We can, go half on the room, and half on a sack
And while you breaking the buzz down, I'ma be hitting it from the back
Bend over baby, I got something to show you baby
Turn around on your back toes up on the shoulders baby
Steady deep stroking don't mind me, just keep smoking
Bust a lot to break the serve and the soda water open
But you ain't my may thang, just a little something to the side
So don't talk when I'm talking on the phone, you keep quiet
Just open your mouth wide and let me put it inside
Smoke a sweet and to finish my cup and then it's time to slide
Don't worry about nothing cause it's confidential
Open up your runway for my ?con? to dent you

(Chorus - 2x (Billy Cook vocalizing in background)
All night long, all night
We be smoked all night
All night long, all night
As we flip and sip pink sprite

[Z-Ro]
Put a six in a Cris we gone sip on that
It's harder than a roll of quarters put your hips on that
Removing your thong, penetrate the pick and it's on
Still sipping and smoking stroking steady making you moan
I'm number 0 City Don, got a cottage by the barn
Automatic gauges vicious dogs roaming the lawn
You got to worry about nothing except for keeping me happy
And if it's with you than a bitch steady tapping and nappy

[DP]
Steady tapping and nappy, getting the headboards clapping
Hell shot, pussy with your man asking what happened
And no excuses out your mouth cause you've been riding with me
Arrange my soldiers, T-H-U-G
See you can tell from the smile and the way that you strip
Something ain't right, though nigga been all up in the guts
Better soak on some alcohol, and leave me alone
Bitch ask for the cash I get it

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
I need a thug bitch, a shop lift and sell drug bitch
But don't be tripping when I'm pimping in the club bitch
We can hit the telly and get under the sheets
Knocking you down till I move around back on the streets
And keep rolling, got to keep my benjamins folding
Then I'm coming back to beat it up until it's swollen 
Baby it's non stopping fix a nigga a plate
So don't worry I be coming to your house real late
Meanwhile I'm a soldier in the battlefield
I'm on a mission trying to get it, I'ma make a mill
With or without you, but if you down
Then we can do it together, drank rubbers and automatic rounds
But don't be tripping when I say I need space
I ain't cheating but it's some reason it's a knee case
I'm a block bleeder, you got to share me with the drugs and shit
But when I'm fucking you it's beautiful I love the shit

Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Girl (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma)

[K-Blunt (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Yo, check the joint, son
Yo, yo, now, bring it back, baby
One time for the Brooklyn Zu
{Ninja habitat} (bring the trauma)
Bring it back one time for the Brooklyn Zu
{Ninja habitat} (bring the trauma)

[K-Blunt]
Dreams of the dreaded drug dealer gettin' drawn back
That's kind of drastic and dreary, I don't like that
That's why I drink til I'm drunk, don't know how to act
Some get prowls in the ground, catch a heart attack
I got destroys from the past, so I'm the true legend
Shining bright, never dull, like those that dwell in heaven
Of all the beings in the universe, I'm the worst
Sometimes I apoligize to my mom, when I curse
Beat drops, making you shake your hips and hop
Sixty four tracks, runaway train, non-stop
Looking at my watch, 12 o'clock, on the dot
Rushin' to the block, so I could sell these rocks
Smoke cess, smuggle on slave ships, from foreign soils
To my lips, had to hittin' horny hoe's with hips
She's bangin' bangin', like Buddha Monk's beats
On our streets, Brooklyn bound, never face defeats
Now you know, why I'm the one to entertain
It's K-Blunt, scream it loud, say my name

[Chorus: Girl (5 Foot Hyper Sniper)]
Ninja habitat (bring the trauma
Eat your ass like Jeffrey Dahmer
Universal unibombers, comma, we heat that ass like saunas
Karma, oops, son, we bring the trauma)
Ninja habit (bring the drama
Eat that ass like Jeffreyy Dahmer
Universal unibombers, comma, we heat that ass like saunas
Karma, oops, son, we bring the trauma)
Ninja habit, muthafuckas!

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
My life struggle, is how I like to couple, who can't get caught
Be on the double with my hustle, I bust you
Got to, Cash Rules Everything Around Me, get the CREAM
And get an eight fifty, let it beam, check my team
We all scheme for diamonds, golds, and rings and things
And put, where mathematics is the verdict
Like Rapper Noyd, I'm seatin' 'pon unlawly, leaves a permanant score
That's the Iron's Eagle Claw, cuz I seek to understand the bond cuz a cureable

[Popa Chief]
It takes a strong knowledge, see, to hold down the foundation
Constant Elevation, I run the whole plantation
Daily expanding, my reservation
Sitting on top of the world, looking down at my creation
The globetrotter, world traveler, Supa Ninja
Raise the roof, is a ball burner
A wise dred bluntly said, hold ya head
Therefore I take this roll like a moped
I keep the best part and out with the trash
And catch wreck like a twenty car crash
Rip a show, get the dough, do the dash
Putting niggas in the full body cast
Cuz I ain't got time, to be sitting around, waiting for miracles
I build with Spiritual, a/k/a Killa Constable
Fuck that happy shit, Buddha Monk's the first nigga to spark shit
And the Manchuz killed it
That's it, that's all, period, end of story
The Ninjaz out for the same and the glory

Song:   Life is a Bitch
Typed by: Lil Hustle

(*Billy Cook vocalizing through song*)

[Z-Ro]
I wonder if I'm blessed, cause I'm still here
And I wonder if heaven's any different, cause in hell the blood spill hits
Got a nigga fiending for his last breath, too many of my partnas
Beneath me, because a bitch made nigga blasted
Too many features in songs, tell me why I ain't got no home
Penitentiary grown, cause I roam with a pocket full of stones
I wanna live my life with my life, ain't worth the living
Cause while I'm dreaming about a Benz, even a hoop ain't driven
Headed for prison, but mama I'm all right with that
Struck down a shank in my tank, these niggas all night with that
And it ain't no love left, fuck all of my foes and friends
Motherfuckers don't fuck with Ro, unless that nigga be rolling in ends
I need to wake up, instead of day dreaming about holding a slab
Like being in love with a woman, that you could never have
Witness the feeling punished by pain, looking for shelter from the rain
People like W double O-D, I'm going against the grain

[Chorus - 2x]
Life is a bitch, then you die
Especially for me, cause I'm a G, one deep when I ride
Pain, and everybody say that I changed
But I was tired of going through it, in this crooked ass game

[Z-Ro]
To all my down ass niggas, y'all can kiss my ass
Anybody who ever said they was down with me, can kiss my ass
In the 2K ace, I'm a sick nigga that's quick to blast
And for the smallest disrespect, I'm coming to get your ass
I done dumped on motherfuckers, what they gon do for me
Out of town on stage, nobody from the hood in the crowd, to root for me
Supposed to be my people, but I think my people is the devil
But my peoples, cause I'm on another level
On my knees, screaming Jesus can you save me
My shit's so fucked up, I wonder if you thought about me lately
And it hurts so deep, a nigga can't sleep, making me late night creep
Suicidal thoughts, I think I'm ready plus its fucking with me
Would I be blessed by these bitch niggas, these fakes and frauds
Fiending for music, cause she know she got my heart
Even thought its torn apart, its bumping out nothing but love for you
And to my niggas keep your business, I got slugs for you
I shed blood for you, but I'm not appreciated
The only nigga that never hesitated, and it ain't no more
Hollering out my roll dogs, name on tape
Unless its fuck you, but in front of it, following up for a cape, bitch

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Life is a bitch then you die, especially for me
Cause I'm a G, one deep when I ride
Motherfuckers went to turning they back, but its all gravy
Nothing but the word of God, is gonna save me
Lately, I've been over doing it with drugs, fuck around
And overdose, but I don't wanna pass away from multiple slugs
This for the world, I hate all bitches, and all niggas
As if everybody wanna see, the king of the ghetto fall nigga
Murder murder on my enemies, I didn't wanna do it
Thought it was God telling me busting, wasn't balm influid
Murder murder on my enemies, I didn't wanna do it
Thought it was God telling me busting, was enbalmin fluid, cause uh

Song:   How Does it Feel
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Z-Ro]
How does it feel, when they don't believe anything you say
Always, got to show and prove yourself every single day
Man this ain't living, nothing but drama all through the week
And if they don't respect my words, why they want me to speak
I'm feeling worse, even though I put my family first
I'm shedding tears cause I feel as if I'm headed to the dirt
Ghetto on me, stressed out my mama buried ain't dead
Ain't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head
Have you ever told a lie to make the drama stop
Watch the world you love turn against you no more family problems
How does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to
Victimized yourself for one time and evermore after the g
And focus on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast
Sitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass
My life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife
I wonder where I got to sleep tonight, my nigga, how does it feel 

(Chorus - 2x)
When you can't make the pain stop
Walking in the rain so your tears can blend in with the rain drops
When your kin people done turned they back
Every family that I know is just like that, my nigga how does it feel

[Z-Ro]
I could of sworn I wasn't the only person on this earth
But it seems, that I've been one deep ever since the day of my birth
I'm sick and tired of being lonely in this crooked land, people think
I'm tripping cause of my facial expressions but they don't understand
24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out
Who was the friend, who was the foes, you know it's bout to drive me crazy
Mama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at
The way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher
Can't I breed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone
Like Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home
Bout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no glocks, and it ain't no sin
No longer watching my back for the retaliation
How does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can
Answer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head
But I'm so scared, my life, my life, 360 degrees
Of being neglected stressing enemies, my nigga, how does it feel

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
How does it feel, when these busters try to take your life
Lord knows I don't want to pull my 45
But see I'ma survive, nigga don't make me use my tool
Get some of that bomb green from Tom 'fore I lose my cool
How can I make to it to the top I'm like a crab in a bucket
It got me hostile, I see my pistol grab it and bust it
Nigga get off me, I don't love nan one of y'all
I'm coming forward you pen and killing every one of y'all
Call me ceaser, get em while they sleeping, I'm grim reaping
Bust and never saw me coming left him with his blood seeping
I'm a soldier, recognize the signs of the time
It seems it's kill or be killed up in this stony life of mine
Can you feel it, when it's hard to rub against a real nigga
How does it feel, to see my blood spill my nigga
My life, my life, feel like I'm running out of time
Till it's over catch me running with my nine, how does it feel

(Chorus - 4x)"

Fuck all of y'all man, it go down
S.U.C. for life, R.I.P. Robert Davis
A.k.a Dj Screw this for you my nigga
Yeah this for you

[Z-Ro]
Everybody know me I'm the number one head buster
With a 4 pound glock ready to make the lead touch you
Cause I shine like a 75 watt light bulb
And if you cross over the line, then I might strike you
I'm going grey, even though a nigga ball everyday
Covered in ice, but ice can't take my problems away
But it sure feel good to know that I can blow twenties
Z-Ro a money making machine dollars no pennies
Nigga please, it's me and my niggas my fucking g's
R.I.P. to Robert Davis on a fresh set of 3's
S.U.C. to the finish I'm going out with my men
With a grenade in my hand I'm comig out with the pin
It'll never be another Screw, kill that drama
That was a man not the music, you can ask his mama
I'ma mourn you, till I join you, up in heaven
Mean while, I'm retarded with this ak47 and uh

[Chorus - 2x]
R.I.P., I be forever repping S.U.C.
Until a nigga get to the tenth time
Mash on the gas and I won't stop, baby

[Z-Ro]
What you know about the dirty south, the dirty fucking third
Nigga fuck what you heard, D.P. on the corner rock for rocking a bird
Here we had it pimping in Cheves and Testerosas
Ro you only got two choices roll with us or get rolled over
Giving a cold shoulder to them 5-O
No liscense plate no registration smoking pino
My nigga we some boss hogs one car taking up all four lanes
Come at me wrong, I'ma have you taking off all your vains
No plexing in Houston Texas got to the green leaving you breathless
Ak'd up your chest nothing but a memory about breakfast
So break fast, with your frosted and fake ass
This ain't the boot nigga this H-Town we'll take your cash
Niggas come against me, but get they ass out
Seem like when I cut on the lights all the roaches scat
And then I let go, because these haters in the way
I'm trying to get stacks taller than Antou Sensi

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
24/7 a nigga be out on the cut
Don't got to hustle no more, but I just can't give it up
Dropping niggas where they standing, with my man tanning
You don't want to box a geurilla these hands steady be landing over and over
Breaking up your gaurd, nigga fuck what you've been going thorugh
Cause you's about to take it up with god
Not a violent nigga, I'm a silent nigga
But if you push my button I'll pull my ultra violet nigga
And watch you shrivel up like salt to a snail
Better keep it under your breath
if you beefing I read these bitch niggas like braile
I'm a soldier, and I'm united by the cash
Feeling to move on because I've been indicted by the tash
But I ain't gone run from it, I'ma ball in public
When they run up on me pull my strap and ask them how they love it
Kamakaze on you son of a bitches, I'm signing off
Mean while I'm still in the trunk, knocking the lining off and uh

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro talking]
First and Foremost, Z-Ro the crooked, what's up
Hollering at all my real niggas, like I always do 
Feel me, R.I.P. Dj Screw, feel me
To all you fake ass niggas holding plex
Hold this dick in your mouth, know I'm saying
All that riff-raff, all you sherry temple ass niggas
Y'all gone feel me, 2k2, I don't give a fuck where you at

Typed by: Lil Hustle

(Chorus)
Too many niggas trying to take me off of my game
Cause a nigga from the hood that done looked some good
Now they all want to jock my fame
But when I'm coming down in my ?born?
And I'm rolling one deep that should tell you about me
I don't give a damn about none of you hoes
I blast on sight cause I ain't tripping no more

[Z-Ro]
Nigga I'm tired, this drama got me booted and fried
At least I got records in the store bitch nigga you getting dried
Steady running around rapping and capping and talking shit
I got gorillas every where be careful who you walking with
Southside, south-sid for live, wouldn't want to be you
Be running up on you closed casket nobody gonna see you
Bitch it's over, barely with Barber right behind me in the rover
My partner from Mercy told you we gone get you if we owe you
Military minded I'm a S.U.C. soldier
Don't want it if it's hard cause the south lets you see over
I'm trying to keep my head on, but it's rolling off my shoulders
When I lost my people god damn, my heart was pumping colder
Shedding crocodile tears, man folks feeling this pain
And left a stain in my brain so I'm cracking like a window pain
On the edge having a conversation with my infrared
All these fuck niggas can get it two to the head and get dead

(Chorus)

[Z-Ro]
It's the return of Z-Ro the Crooked busting heads strictly for cash
Taking out contracts on haters with a beam and a mask
You can run you can hide but it ain't no escaping
I'm a trend setter with a beretta for real it ain't no faking
I done showed up, then I poured up, then I blowed up like heats
Diamond slugs up on my teeth, I done been violent fuck the peace
I got a slug for these haters that's approaching me wrong
Let them mash off in first class there ain't no coaching my song
Hydro-V to the dome, with it on back to the chrome
I'm kind of quick to click so get gone or catch one to the dome
Mo-City Texas that's my home, but I can rome all over
So it's ghetto love these cats gone get me full up on sober
Real recognize real, and the fake gone fade away
Use to selling drugs to get that pay, but god done mad a way
For me to stack my ends, my paper, my moola, my fetty
And took this by surprise I knew you hoes wasn't ready

(Chorus)

[Z-Ro]
Remember back in 94' they use to laugh at me team
Now it's year 2k2 women be after me team
But fuck a female, it's all about my retail
On tapes and c.d.'s they was capping I stay making daily breakers
C.d., and they chose to make tapes, up on the stage
It use to be all about hooping now I'm all about getting paid
Getting leid I can miss it, I'd rather have my digits
Trying to get up on me a stack, taller than the tallest midget
I'm on bitches than a red nose pit, with his mouth on it
I be platinum 'fore it's over bitch I put the south on it
You can put your mouth on it, if you ain't than zip it up
Get off my dick bitch right quick because I'm about to rip it up
And for no reason at all, it's fuck y'all
Fuck around and get to busting so you best to best duck dog
I've been going through a whole thang, everyday
So I don't give a damn if you get chose man I got this k, and I don't play

Roll a Five Hundred Wagon, we blasting the morgue

That's when I planned out, see I just cash out
Make sure it's all there, Dat Nigga Daz out
Now I'm swerving and swerving nigga, without a doubt

I'ma pledge allegiance, to this crooked ass game
Walking backwards through this rhythm this nation, without a name

Cause I come from Holiday, there's no other prison like it
I fuck with niggas like Chill, and the Don Keke
Cause not only are they killas, they be about they currency
Somebody told me Z-Ro, get your ass up and go
Get a job but my job, got to be filling out applications it's hard
For a young black male, to stack male
But do it legal, without the help of a crack sale
That's asking too much, cause my people having it rough
That's just your ghetto, everyday average stuff
From California to Texas, people are restless and they starving
Like predators after the prey, they gon come barging
Just like the police, you might as well call us the Fed
Because we running shit undercover, but making our bread

I'm trying to make it, but the world want me to take it

I make one and pay three, I gots to make two mo'
And coming short don't add up, niggas wanna agg' up
Uncock the gun lil' nigga, put the mask up

Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying

How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride

Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherfucker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus 
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police
Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a AK and a HK and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been 18 lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

[Z-Ro]
Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

[Chorus - 2x]"

You're gonna get fuckin' busted, I'm fuckin' telling ya

Only sixteen, a hottie across the street
Washing her daddy's car, she was toying with me
She came inside and promised wouldn't take long
She's about to swallow when my lady came home and caught me

Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima
Down on my knees, get ready, here she comes
I'm begging you please, get ready, Hiroshima

She was bitchin' mad out of control, like Hiroshima
I thought the bitch was gonna explode, like Hiroshima

I never smoke, my woman hates it, it's wrong
But this ganja, Mike Peezy had, it just smelt so strong
Roll it up, fuck it, I puffed it and passed
Not knowing my woman was standing right behind my ass

I love this woman just as much as one can
Some things I do, she will never understand
I love Dark Lotus, and she loves The Cure
I love my wrestling, and she says it's absurd (she don't like The Rock)
She disses my style (your style), she disses my rap (say what)
She makes my dick hard when she sits on my lap (oh)
If she dissed my homies, I guarantee you some drama
I'll pack that bitch's shit up, send her back to her mama

Sunshine, trying to make a million hustling got to dodge
One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

[Z-Ro]
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

[Chorus]

[Lil' Keke]
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your cuz
I wish I was, able to socialize with y'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from y'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why y'all turning up y'all nose 
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up y'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

Oooh oooh (what what what what what?)
{Hahahahahha} Get ready get ready
{What what enter enter}
(Where that nigga? Where that nigga?)
(Niggaz wanna make noise get ready) (Slicer slicer)
{Only the rare beast will be destroy by you Ninjaz and your techniques}
{For here are the elements of a ninja}
{That we bring forth to destroy all those
who try to destroy all those who to try reclaim}
{those royal famous techniques of those who think they have the real jewels}
{Assassins enter this world} (Enter) {Let's begin}
{Enter the Ninjaz slum}

[K-Blunt]
Question, answer, who's the believer?
True believers break us down and deceive us
Images reflect like foil, mad turmoil
Causin' brain tissue to uncoil
Cultural like irrigation
Control the population with female genital pre-relations
Defy the laws of gravity
Scientifical scientists can't comprehend us, a catastrophy
Tossin' hooks from trees, separated at the knees
Intense pain, you can't SCREAM
Wish you could, ya petrified like wood
Now I chop ya head 'til ya ass is good
Remember this, I feed like photosynthesis
Remember this, ways, a sharp tight disc gets thrown
Slice so deep, in to the bone, burnin' Blunt with rabies
I fall on this microphone
You couldn't see the force for the trees, yet you believe
As you descend, beneath (nigga dyin' nigga what?) Ha ha.. bring it back

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Niggaz get scalped, fuckin' with this Amityville Horror house
Knifes in the pillows of their couch
Go through ya ass, boss, make a route
Come out ya naval, disconnectin' ya tables, to the swords
Sword choppin' ya, breathe the force!
Wrap you like syran wrap, shouldn't have worn that
Like Kojak, told you on Zu tracks 'bout my axe
Fiends for blood, caught them in my den
I let my Ninjaz begin slicin' ya skin
(Ouch hits the blades, comin' in slicin' on limbs!)
Slashin' 'em, gashin' 'em
The dumb, deaf and blind, refined, the 85 mind
Get 'em off the swine, slice his spin
Get him open, in every direction, fire off intersections
Leave 'em, never, open operate, new Blunt, cut him new wounds
Can't escape, the tales, from the Ninjaz tombs

[Interlude: Buddha Monk]
Ninja habitat, your mission is not complete, protect please

[D.L.]
Never mind that, yo, where ya mind at?
It's in the gutter, motherfucker
Leave you on cloud nine, I'm packin' mine
Fully refined, re-designed for ninety-nine
Refrained from swine, cheap wine, dirty behind
You can't come near me, you wanna kill me cuz you fear me
You spineless, I rip ya back out, sucker you hear me?
The total rap package, automatic street sweepin'
Lyrical manifester sent here to bless ya
I'm a messenger deliverin' unabombs
My arsenal is limitless
Check my file, shit hits, you make licks, mimick this
You can't do this shit, it's home son
You couldn't swing it cuz all you hit was home runs
You out the ballpark, not even close to my rawness
I knock out artists, annihilatin' any target
Don't start it (Hhahhaa) Nigga

[Babyface Fensta]
Pirate, nitwit, esophagus
Spit rancid acid at ya head like the horn of a rhinocerous
Preposterous statements'll go through, few and dangerous
Circumstances like startin' beef you wasn't ready for
Was takin' too many chances
Daredevil, ya rebel in splender
My agenda, descend the Earth nation, contend with despicable heathens
Leave bodies floatin' like casualties from navy battleships
Twist like fronto and I know that nigga and his bitch
Reality, six in ya midst, dimension descension
Duct tapin', interrogatin', Gillettes, electric shocks, wet
Russian roulette with society misfits
Bleedin' and crippled, neutral nemesis, subsequent offenses
Death penalty, ya whole family, tragedy
Gibberish, rhettoric, condemned

[Intro: 5 Foot Hyper Sniper (K-Blunt)]
This shit is fat like Fat Albert
Now I'm gonna sing a song for you
	""All I hear is gunshots"" > Method Man (repeats throughout song)
Check me out, check me out, check me out
(Watch this, no, check me out, nigga, fuck you)

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
As I look to the sky, see why
Another brother had to die, caused by
Brooklyn Zu, I think, what I gots to do
Not to get caught in that trigger happy madness
Forget a fold up, I gonna fight for the right to live another night
And smoke the blunts with the dutch, keep the girlies on the hunt
I can't miss, my uncle started me, trained, my skills are top rate
No hits are bast', don't give me a pump, I'll blast
I'm takin' all things, in the street rebel
I'm givin' the pain across the grain
I bag the hoes, they scream ""my nigga
With the .357, sent ya to the grave""
Who cares about a slave? It's a war zone, now we there
Bodies drop, hit hittin' the concrete
The wanted Irie tryin' not to get caught in the heat
Fuck that, police pile more victims up
They killed Nutso, fuck cappies when I toss ones
To fight like George Bronson

[K-Blunt]
Lemme do that shit...
No shorts, you know that K-Blunt will never seen 'em
Always in the middle with the killotine
Greetings, welcome to the new kind of game
The dealer shuffle up the deck, a shame
Rule number one, fuck around and see who's havin' fun
My arm under the table with my hand on the gun
Number two, what ya gonna do?
No second guessin', everybody's stressin'
Rule number three, all wanna see
Chaotic with the gate to the beacon, that's deep
Always on the move now, it's ya turn
Jumpin' in the fire, ya bound to get burned
Or get stuck cuz we do the stickin'
The one with the most, that's the one we gettin'
Think ya got fucked once again my friend
It's a sure win, 5 Foot, begins
Now then we'll see, how should I end
Can't take a seat now, bender 'possed to bend
I think it's best for you to interrupt
But watch ya move cuz ya might get bucked
Like an eight plus Blunt, got plenty loot son
What ya want, uh, all I hear is gunshots

[Interlude: K-Blunt]
All I hear is gunshots, nigga
All I hear is gunshots, nigga..
What's up, nigga? What's real?
Gunshots, nigga, all I hear is gunshots
5 Foot ninja, on the rap
Smokin' trees, killa with steez

[K-Blunt]
It's the man, ran like the Candy, kid
Well ya gettin' vexed, ya can't stand what I did
Said I couldn't do it but I brought mine
You're full of holes like a strainer, ya leakin' fluid
Representin' Jersey, you can't hurt me
Tell ya that ya suck like a Kirby
Comin' in like the wind, livin' single, livin' single
Been around the world with the girls, yes I mingle
Lady killer, no faith in magic makin', baby undertakin'
Shakin' like a rattle, don't try, ya don't really wanna battle me
Cuz I roll the best, gun clap, without a tat
You we gets water, it's first degree murder, no manslaughter
Ya hopin' it's a hazard, ya Dirty Bastard
Now I have to, show that shit I mastered
I make the average nigga write a verse
Hit the mirror and rehearse, apologize to my moms when I curse
Now tell me, how yo' ass wanna see it
Is it black and white? Is it a front and color on the scene?

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Fuck that, I'm comin' with the bats and the gats
5 Foot, Ninjaz, formin' on ass, get 'em, we scrap on tracks
Fuck that, in fact, I wanna kill, I gets the skill
My mic get bright, I'm King Midas
I'm undercover like the spy from the left with the dump
We show our guns, we carry the weight
We wipe ya out, we super fit, I wrecks, I kill
I'm fat like that movie Sugar Hill
Bring it away, my wisdom with the rescue, now who's the lock and key?
I stay in the mix, no tricks, I'm sick, I give 'em fits
I love to drop, my rhymes in truth
I be the type like the Night of the Living Dead
I got the smiles like my first pair of croquets
I've been down since the nitty gritty's on the way
A night activity, lost in city, can't you hear it?

Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Z-Ro]
Let my coedine settle, and have a toast one time
Multiplications on my digits, come up over some time
3-57 in my spine, they can't hold me like Kobe Bryant
Powered up, popping tulips and clovers and stop signs
Taylor made, Gucci looking like a million bucks
Neck full of gold baggets, and trillion cuts
I reside on cuts, cause having money is a must
Give me the issue or get touched, the scuffling up
Fuck with the raw like a cut, cause I hit too hard
Radio stations don't play, cause I spit too hard
I know they hate me everyday, and I ain't quit so far
But if you cross the line, AK is gone hit your car

[Hook]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the throwdest of them all
Cause you know my name, it's Z-Ro the Crooked
Z-Ro the Mo City Don, it ain't over it just begun
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the throwdest of them all
Cause you know my name, it's Z-Ro represent the third coast
Let my codeine settle, and have a toast

[Z-Ro]
I'm a guerilla that's after the scrilla, I cock glocks
I'm the top knotch, body armored like Shaq done blocked shots
Dropping cops cause they crooked, I'm the law now
Posted on the corner, selling raw now
Looking for them people, keep an open eye
And if I see the jackers, never hesitate I gotta open fire
Active like a live wire, retalliation is a must
Rock and buy these bezzels, and then I bust
Geniva watch, telling me it's time to ball
Get in the line till I make it to the front, and then it's time to fall
But if I ever fall off, just fall back behind the scene
Take seven, catch me up in sitcoms and big screens

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
When I roll, I roll one deep
I never stop wrecking, these H-Town streets
And ain't nobody holding me down I'm a roll, I'm rolling
If you didn't know Southside still holding, folding
Big lemon faces, got real money cause I catch cases
Sipping on skeet tastes, and I'ma lean in private or public places
Milicated refreshness, keep my mind at ease
Trying to reach another level, keep me climbing trees
Coming smoke out my nose, bald faded minus before
Keep it gangsta, got groupie hoes striking a pose
But see they ain't getting chose, or catch me tipping my dob
I need a independent thug chick, launder money and drug shit
I'm the boss hog, ain't nobody hogging me over harder
Soft then I'm off, in the funk in my roller

I'm a stranger in the midst, a star
I'm dodging death with every breath, because my world is torn
You hate me now, but see me lay a pistol in my palm
It's a hustling team, but still we thugging on, my word is born

[Z-Ro]
They lay me down, lay the pistol in my palm, must thought
It was over, when they put two in my back plus put one in my arm
But I'm a soldier, ain't traveling toward no tunnel with no bright light
I kick it with murderers, steady busting gun shots
And a kin, of any one of my enemies
Drowning in marijuana, codeine, sherm and hennessy
I'm outside of my mind, but I'm not trying to find a way back
Cause I live by it and die by it, I'm talking about my strap
4-4, she be the only lady showing me love
Niggaz get nervous when they see us, cause they know we thug
Military minded, but I'm trying to mind my own
Niggaz running up on my ride, got me in a friense brandishing my weapon
Ain't no second guessing, release first live life
I'm busting on motherfuckers, and touching they wind pipe
I got a bullet up in the chamber, bullet up in the chamber
Run nigga run, cause your ass in some danger

[Hook - 2x]

[Klondike Kat]
First things first off top, mama raised no fool
I was brought up in that South, in the swamps dropping too smooth
Hustling taking life, it ain't as trifling
Never will get catched dog, and corrupt snatching this
I be just, kicking the game while I'm young and
You should be thinking the same, don't be dumb
A small heart and a soft ass, that an't gon lasted
I'm watching all my niggaz, I grew up before in a casket
Some sad shit I seen in myself, pulling reefer
Black history, that was taught by my teacher
Go to Pimping Tina next do', I know she tweaking
But I ain't know she better hits know, until I be dead
Young nigga what you seeking, outside looking in
I'm here on this black top, confused with a flat top
They got dope in the streets, cause the game
I'm a stranger with no name, I'm for the fame my nigga

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm a stranger, cause I'm a nigga you ain't seen
Face to face with death, bitch nigga you can't scream
Better cherish this your last breath, cause you done walked
Into an unfed guerilla, nigga now witness your last step
I was creeping, with the sawed off
In a rage bo'guard, blowing niggaz balls off
I'm the reaper, touching fellas on madula-oblan-gatta
Will I ever regret it, I think nada

[Klondike Kat]
I got this evil balling up inside, riding with my 4-5
And it'll be in my blood, I hope it's gon before I die
Grown men we don't cry, about it
Just put our straps up real high, then we walk about it
Gon be about it till I'm gone, I'm a gator boy
Knock the tops off a hater, for that paper boy
I'm just a stranger ain't asking for shit, then ask for life
But the Lord gave in, and you know he sha'll take it away

Song:   Shelter From Da Storm
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Z-Ro]
Of course I'm thankful for another day, my Lord I can't lie
But everytime I wake up, seem like one of my people gotta die
Anthrax poisoning, Hussein and them blew up the Trade Center
Summer, Fall, Spring, Winter, people in the projects getting thinner
Barely enough government cheese, left to feed the rats
But we gotta get it how we live, and how we live is selling crack
How we live is kicking doors, how we live is pimping whores
How we live is what we do, so we don't live like this no more
How we live is wrapping em up, sipping on my weight to receive
An overloaded Houston Texas, niggaz make they own bleed
Every night another murder scene, that could of been prevented
But the truth is we most def, and the last soul tormented
Every now and then I duck my head, up in the sunday service
That's the only place where 5-0, won't burst us bust us
Nigga they don't love us, they wanna relocate us to the Penn
We wanna do right, but all we see is sin

[Hook]
In this land, we need you Jesus
Lord have mercy, we need shelter in the time of storm
Uh-huh, well, well, well

[Z-Ro]
Yeah, Rosta fall right help me, help me
All the young picking them, living in a rush just to get wealthy (wealthy)
And in the ghetto, we struggle or we hustle til we bubble
On top, eliminating competition when we buck shot
Don't press that new, but a new clear shot
Fire, fire, fire, fire (fire)
Too many sickness and disease, under attack from overseas
Mighty job me and for God, please come save the day
If I should die before I wake, me leave a blessing for the people today
Mighty job me and for God upon you, take this pain away

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Now I lay me, down to sleep
I pray the Lord keep my body, as my enemies creep
Don't wanna be another statistic, living through c.d.'s
Either the graveyard or max. security, prison you'll see G
Look at the homie's little girl, she ain't nothing but sixteen
Trying to support three kids, so she stay coming out her jeans
Getting pimped, by somebody that still live with they mama
But that's the only way she know, to get away from all the drama
As for books, the mind is a terrible thing to waste
As for crooks, the line is a terrible thing to taste
Ask them niggaz that don bit the bullet, but they still here
My nigga we ain't seen God befo', but we still fear
I asked him for a plexing, and he sent me Eugene
Now I got two cars, a crib and everyday I dress clean
But it ain't no love, they wanna put a nigga in the Penn
I wanna do right, but all I see is sin
