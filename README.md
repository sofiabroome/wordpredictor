We've used Ipython Notebooks to experiments with language models.

Experiments_Jeremy.ipynb - Jeremy's experiments about n-grams models, smoothing and probability distributions

sofiaexperiments1.ipynb - Sofia's

sofiaexperiments2.ipynb - Sofia's

stuff.ipynb - Erik's

test_grammar.ipynb - Valentin's experiments about grammar

The models for our respective n-gram models (ngram with or without grammar model) are in the folder "models". The abstract class was made because we tried different models before the 2 general models remaining.
